= LaTeX-unicode-math-mode

This is an emacs minor mode for entering unicode math symbols in
LaTeX.  It automatically replaces inputs like `\phi` with `φ` and
`\in` with `∈`.  These replacements happen inside of math environments
or everywhere, depending on the configuration.

You probably want `\usepackage{unicode-math}` to make LaTeX aware of
the unicode characters.

Add this to your emacs configuration somewhere *after* loading auctex:
----
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/LaTeX-unicode-math-mode/")
(require 'LaTeX-unicode-math-mode)

;; Enable LaTeX-unicode-math-mode automatically for all LaTeX files.
;; This converts LaTeX to unicode inside math environments.
(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'LaTeX-unicode-math-mode)

;; Enable LaTeX-unicode-global-mode automatically for all LaTeX files.
;; This converts LaTeX to unicode everywhere in the buffer.
;; Don't activate both this and LaTeX-unicode-math-mode at the same time.
;;(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'LaTeX-unicode-global-mode)
----

Tested with pdflatex from TeX Live 2015 and GNU Emacs 24.5.1.

== Bugs

Due to the implementation, this minor mode will probably break your
input method.  If you do not know what an input method is or if you
only write in English or in other European languages, chances are you
are not using one.
